            <h4 class="mt-4">What We Do</h4>
            <p class="lead">
              Coding Classroom teaches children aged 5 to 17 how to code, understand Artificial Intelligence (AI), and use basic computer skills. Our goal is to prepare them for a future where digital skills are essential. Our work also supports Goal 4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals — Quality Education for All.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">How It Started</h4>
            <p class="lead">
              Coding Classroom began in 2019 during my time at Schoolab, a startup incubator in Paris. Over six months, I developed the vision, mission, and full curriculum. After that, I started running coding workshops for migrant children, especially those from Myanmar, to give them valuable digital skills and meaningful learning opportunities.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Our Vision</h4>
            <p class="lead">We want all Myanmar children to learn coding.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h4>
            <p class="lead">
              We support Myanmar migrant and refugee children and youth on the Thai-Burma border by teaching coding and computer skills. Our school offers free or low-cost classes with friendly instructors, local language support, and a safe learning environment. We aim to help young people build a better future through digital knowledge.
            </p>
